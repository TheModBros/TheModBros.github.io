Please read it. It's nothing like any of the letters but I need you to know it. If you ever need anything just ask me k?-->

 <p>
Originally formed in 2011 as a way for 2 young minds to share our Minecraft skills. TheModBros started off only providing Minecraft mod packs. In early 2012, EDR and JackieBoi asked more friends to join the team. At that time, not many wanted to join. Later that year, We started working on Minecraft maps and skins.</p>
 <p>
     Skip to 2014, we have moved from working on only maps and modpacks, to making full on mods, ready to play whenever you want. It's been a while, but our dreams of this company have finally been completed. We know how to mod and are releasing them on this website. </p>
			<p>Skip over to the summer of 2015, we learned more languages. From simple HTML and CSS to a little more complicated jQuery, to a little more JavaScript. However the only Java we know is primarily just Minecraft Mod Coding.  This website is even one of the other products created by the head coder, Edward. We&#39;re even thinking of learning Swift, to begin creating iOS Apps.</p>

                <!--<p>br>&#160;&nbsp;&#160;&nbsp;我们是谁？
TheModBros 是一个组。我们都是很好的电脑游戏学生。我们大家要使这个世界娱乐。我们都在香港，中国。我们都说英文和一点儿中文。</p>

<br>&#160;&nbsp;&#160;&nbsp;我们原来在2011因为两个头脑共享我们的Minecraft技能。TheModBros开始人Minecraft mod pack。在2012年年初，EDR 和 JackieBoi 问朋友加入我们。当时，没有很多人要加入。那年晚些时候，我们开始做Minecraft maps和skins。
          <br>&#160;&nbsp;&#160;&nbsp;现在球队有两个以上的学生。我们有多个学生创建电视在独立的渠道，增强的游戏对于游戏玩家，的道路上允许玩家世界一个更愉快地体院。

                <br>&#160;&nbsp;&#160;&nbsp;我们现在有两队；一个球队主力和一个项目小组。球队主力做很多的功课但是项目小组是Beta测试。 我们有一个加盟帮我们获得已知。
