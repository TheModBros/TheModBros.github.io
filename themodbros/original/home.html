 <p>
Originally formed in 2011 as a way for 2 young minds to share our Minecraft skills. TheModBros started off only providing Minecraft mod packs. In early 2012, EDR and JackieBoi asked more friends to join the team. At that time, not many wanted to join. Later that year, We started working on Minecraft maps and skins.</p>
 <p>
     Skip to 2014, we have moved from working on only maps and modpacks, to making full on mods, ready to play whenever you want. It's been a while, but our dreams of this company have finally been completed. We know how to mod and are releasing them on this website. </p>
			<p>Skip over to the summer of 2015, we learned more languages. From simple HTML and CSS to a little more complicated jQuery, to a little more JavaScript. However the only Java we know is primarily just Minecraft Mod Coding.  This website is even one of the other products created by the head coder, Edward. We&#39;re even thinking of learning Swift, to begin creating iOS Apps.</p>

                <!--<p>br>&#160;&nbsp;&#160;&nbsp;我们是谁？
TheModBros 是一个组。我们都是很好的电脑游戏学生。我们大家要使这个世界娱乐。我们都在香港，中国。我们都说英文和一点儿中文。</p>

<br>&#160;&nbsp;&#160;&nbsp;我们原来在2011因为两个头脑共享我们的Minecraft技能。TheModBros开始人Minecraft mod pack。在2012年年初，EDR 和 JackieBoi 问朋友加入我们。当时，没有很多人要加入。那年晚些时候，我们开始做Minecraft maps和skins。
          <br>&#160;&nbsp;&#160;&nbsp;现在球队有两个以上的学生。我们有多个学生创建电视在独立的渠道，增强的游戏对于游戏玩家，的道路上允许玩家世界一个更愉快地体院。

                <br>&#160;&nbsp;&#160;&nbsp;我们现在有两队；一个球队主力和一个项目小组。球队主力做很多的功课但是项目小组是Beta测试。 我们有一个加盟帮我们获得已知。

			<p id="hidden">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jack, this is for you. I know your situation wasn't the best, but I really hope you're ok. You really mean a lot to me and I really can't imagine what my life would be without you. These past couple months were really rough personally. Starting the year with you and ending it without you was really depressing. You're still my best friend and I refuse to let you go. Yeah sometimes you might be a pain in the butt, but you're still one of the most trusted and most amazing person I know. Clearly you listened to the instruction above in the commented out text. This isn't commented out clearly, just hidden. Anyhow, you're still my best friend no matter what. I know I wasn't a great friend to you at the start of 2015, but I promise I'm here for you here on out. Yeah you might've put her before us, and yeah I was slightly pissed, but it doesn't give me an excuse to push you away. Especially when you needed someone. Like I said in one of the letters, it's who I am and a part of my job to be there for those who're in need, those who need someone there, and I promised you years ago, back in G3 that I'd be here for you. I failed. But it's time I did something about that. From here on out, I'm here. I know I repeated a lot in this but, I needed to get it out. You're my best friend and to some extent, I love you. (No homo). I can't wait to see you again. Oh and by the way, don't worry about school, I'll help you as much as I can. Yeah I know you'll be repeating, but I still have some of my papers, and almost all the stuff from like Science and Math with me still – Sorta. Don't worry about school. I'm here for you and I'll help you as much as you need. You aren't alone. Don't be afraid to call out for help. Oh yeah by the way, ignore the favicon or the logo on top, I needed to use something so it wasn't just a weird ass blank page. So I just used a picture of my Minecraft Skin. Anyhow thanks for reading this. Sincerely, your brother, Edward.</p>
